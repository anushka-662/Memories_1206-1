# Memories

##Introduction
Using React, Node.js, Express & MongoDB I learnt how to build a Full Stack MERN Application . The App is called "Memories" and it is a simple social media app that allows users to post interesting events that happened in their lives.

## 
Database:
The database used is MONGODB COMPASS.

##Frontend:
REACT is used for Frontend. AXIOS is used for API.

##Features:
-> The user can create a post.
-> The user can delete a post.
-> The user can update a post.
-> The user can like a post.

##TeckStack Used:
Techstack used is MERN STACK.

##Future Scope:
-> The facility for adding video along with image can be provided.
-> Login concept can be implemented, so that a single user can have two or more accounts in a single app.
-> The proper date at which the memory was created can be added.(Now, it only shows the time at which the user created a memory)
